# Spatial Multimodal Analysis of Transcriptomes and Metabolomes in Tissues

This repository contains all the scripts needed to reproduce the images presented in the article [Spatial 
Multimodal Analysis of Transcriptomes and Metabolomes in 
Tissues](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.26.525195v1). 

## Set up
In order to reproduce the figures of the article go through the following steps.

### Download the data
The data are published on several platforms and in different formats:
- MALDI-MSI raw data (imzML files) are available on Figshare at the following URL: 
https://figshare.scilifelab.se/articles/dataset/Spatial_Multimodal_analysis_SMA_-_Mass_Spectrometry_Imaging_MSI_/22770161
- In situ sequencing data are available on Zenodo at the following URL: https://zenodo.org/record/7861508
- Raw and processed Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) data are available on Figshare at the following URL 
https://figshare.scilifelab.se/articles/dataset/Spatial_Multimodal_Analysis_SMA_-_Spatial_Transcriptomics/22778920 
-  Raw and processed ST data are available also on GEO at the following URL: 
https://figshare.scilifelab.se/articles/dataset/Spatial_Multimodal_Analysis_SMA_-_Spatial_Transcriptomics/22778920
- MALDI-MSI and ST processed data are available on Mendeley Data at the following URL 
https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/w7nw4km7xd/draft?a=4a71c2b4-81a8-4c4e-8cb4-b099128f25c1

For simplicity we will use the processed data. Download it from the Mendeley Data website and keep it in a folder 
named `data`.
